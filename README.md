# Traditional Switch Challenge

In this challenge, we'll be using the NATO alphabet to replace a character or letter, with NATO's standardized word for that letter.

NATO phonetic alphabet
A = Able, B = Baker, C = Charlie, D = Dog, E = Easy F = Fox, G = George, H = How, I = Item, J = Jig K = King, L = Love, M = Mike, N = Nan, O = Oboe P = Peter, Q = Queen, R = Roger, S = Sugar, T = Tare U = Uncle, V = Victor, W = William, X = X-ray, Y = Yoke, Z = Zebra

To do this: 
1. Create a new char variable. 
2. Use the traditional switch statement (with a colon in case labels) that tests the value in the variable from Step 1. 
   - Create cases for the characters,  A, B, C, D, and E.
   - Display a message in each case block, with the letter and the NATO word, then break. 
   - Add a default block, which displays the letter with a message saying not found.
